## 💰 The Allure of Quick Withdrawals — Why Traders Want to Skip Verification

Let’s be honest. Every trader wants **fast withdrawals**, especially after a profitable session. That’s when the **temptation to avoid verification** kicks in. Nobody wants to upload documents, wait for approval, or be asked personal questions. We get it — *it feels intrusive*.

But here’s the truth: **Quotex**, like any legitimate trading platform, operates under international anti-money laundering (AML) laws and financial regulations. That means **account verification isn’t optional** — it’s mandatory if you want full access to **withdrawal features**.

⏩ So the real question isn't *“Can I withdraw without verification?”* It’s **“What happens if I try to withdraw without verifying?”**

## ✅ Understanding Quotex’s KYC Policy

Before you can withdraw from **Quotex**, you’ll eventually be asked to complete their **KYC (Know Your Customer)** process. This usually involves:

- A government-issued ID (passport, national ID, or driver’s license)
- Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement, etc.)
- Sometimes a selfie or video verification for identity confirmation

🔍 **Why does Quotex ask for this?**
Because they’re legally obligated to:

- Prevent fraud and scams
- Comply with anti-money laundering laws
- Protect traders from identity theft
- Secure the platform from bad actors

Failing to complete this step will lead to **withdrawal restrictions**, and in some cases, **account suspension**.

## ⚠️ What Happens If You Try to Withdraw Without Verification?

Let’s get straight to it. Here’s what happens when you try to **withdraw funds from Quotex without verifying your identity**:

### 1. **Initial Withdrawals Might Go Through**
When you first join **Quotex**, you might be able to withdraw small amounts without triggering the KYC check. This is because the system allows **micro-withdrawals** as a gesture of trust and ease-of-use.

However…

> ❗️Once your total withdrawals or individual request exceeds a certain threshold, Quotex will **pause your transaction** and request verification.

### 2. **Withdrawal Will Be Frozen for Review**
If you request a withdrawal of a large amount, expect an email or in-app message asking you to upload documents. Your funds will be placed on **hold** until you complete verification.

### 3. **Unverified Accounts Are Red-Flagged**
Trying to bypass or delay KYC puts your account under **manual review**, which slows things down. It can also lead to a **temporary suspension** of your account activity.
