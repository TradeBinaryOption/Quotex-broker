## 💰 Factors That Influence Your Withdrawal Time

Let’s break down the most common reasons **why your withdrawal might be delayed** and how to avoid them.

If your account isn’t verified, expect delays. Quotex follows **KYC (Know Your Customer)** protocols.

**To avoid delays, make sure you:**

---

### ✅ 2. **Withdrawal Method Choice**

Your choice of withdrawal method has the biggest impact on **speed**. 

- **Crypto** is the fastest 🚀 (if blockchain congestion isn’t high).
- **Bank transfers** are the slowest, especially international ones.
- **E-wallets** strike a balance between speed and security.

⏩ **Choose e-wallets or crypto** if you want your money ASAP.

---

### ✅ 3. **Timing of the Request**

Submitting a request on a **Friday night or weekend**? Expect it to be processed on **Monday or Tuesday**. Most financial institutions don’t operate on weekends.
